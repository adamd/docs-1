# Stoplight v4.1.0 Release

This update includes fair use billing, magic links, custom css, and more.

## New ðŸš€

- **[Fair Use Billing](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/getting-started/billing)**: Our paid plans now only count active members that have created a project or updated project files in the past 30 days. This better aligns cost to value, and results in a lower bill in all cases. Now your members will only be added to your bill if and when they start creating content on Stoplight. Unleash your Engineers!Â 
- **Annual Billing**: Save up to 20%.
- **[Magic Invite Links](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/organizations/invite-people)**: Share it via email, Slack, and other channels to easily onboard members in your organization. Fair use billing means they wonâ€™t count until they actually start creating content. Abra Kadabra.Â 
- **[Custom CSS](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/design/custom-css)**: Add some custom style and flair to your documentation with Custom CSS.Â 
- **Custom HTML Landing Pages**: Create beautiful custom landing pages to greet and direct your users.Â 
- **[OAuth2 Token Generation in Hubâ€™s Try it Out](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/oauth-hubs)**: If your API is protected by OAuth2, you can now generate tokens in the Try it Out block.

## Enhancements ðŸ’ª

- **Relative $refs**: References from one file to another in the same project are now represented with relative URLs. For example, `./models/user.json` instead of `https://exporter.stoplight.io/45/master/models/user.json`. This has a number of benefits, such as increased portability. It also sets the stage for better desktop local file editing and versioning.
- **Published hubs now support Internet Explorer 11**
